                p In the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth, The moon and the Sun, The seas and sand, And the Dunes from which they emerged. No one really knows exactly what they&apos;re doing or who they are.<br><br> If you&apos;re searching for them they can be found mainly on the Space Coast of Florida and sometimes in the Tampa Bay Area. They are not hostile. They are usually down for a good time. If you encounter them, you MUST bring them an offering of Busch Light.<br><br> Dunies only have one goal in life... To Live, Laugh, and Die.
